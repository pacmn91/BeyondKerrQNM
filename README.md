# BeyondKerrQNM
This repository provides the modifications to the Teukolsky equation and to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies due to higher-derivative corrections. It contains the following folders:
-Potentials: files with the analytic correction to the Teukolsky potential
-QNM_shifts: the linear shifts in the Kerr QNM frequencies for a range of values of the black hole angular momentum
Fits: coefficients of the polynomial fits of the previous shifts as a function of the angular momentum

The Mathematica notebook Example.nb contains a visualization of the results.
